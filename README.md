The Movies App is a mobile application developed with React Native, enabling users to explore and discover information about movies. It uses
the [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to retrieve movie data, offering features such as searching for movies, viewing movie details, exploring trending movies, upcoming releases, top-rated movies, and accessing casting details. Additionally, I have incorporated various enhancements, including the ability to select seats, view ticket lists, and access profile information.
